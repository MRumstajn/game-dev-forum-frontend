# GameDeveloperForum - frontend

### About

This is the front-end project for the GameDeveloperForum app. The entire front-end is built using React, Tiller, and Tailwind frameworks and libraries,
and also a few other helpful tools.

### Starting the app

1. Setup and start the backend project
2. Run `yarn install` in the front-end project root directory - this will install the dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` in the front-end project root directory - this starts the app in your web browser

### Authentication

Upon starting the app for the first time, the backend project will generate a default admin user and a random password for it.
Copy the login details from the console of the backend application and use them to log into the app.
The default password will not be printed to the console again, therefore it is advised to change it on the profile settings after the initial login.
